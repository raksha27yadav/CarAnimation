# CarAnimation
car animation purely made with HTML,CSS,and JS.

also it is responsive.

css played the most important role in this project.
i've used transform function in css to rotate the wheel in right direction and translateX to move the track in left direction and thus it seems like car is moving.also the cloud is moving in left direction.

also i've added one song in background to give a feel using javascript.
